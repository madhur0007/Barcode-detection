## Introduction
This repository provides a solution for barcode detection using the YOLOv8 object detection model. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection model that can accurately detect objects in images or videos. In this project, YOLOv8 is trained and used to detect barcodes in images and videos.

## Features
Efficient and fast barcode detection using YOLOv8.
Support for both image and video input.
Easy to train the model with custom datasets.
Export trained models for inference across different environments.
Real-time barcode detection via webcam feed.
Supports popular frameworks like PyTorch.

## Prerequisites
To use this repository, you need the following dependencies installed on your machine:

Python 3.x: Ensure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed.
PyTorch: Install PyTorch compatible with your system and GPU.
YOLOv8: Install the YOLOv8 repository or ultralytics package.
